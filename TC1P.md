Running hg status showed that flag.enc was marked with a !, indicating that it was missing (deleted). However, since the file had been committed in the past, it was still part of the repository's history.

The command hg revert flag.enc was used to undo the deletion. This pulled the last committed version of flag.enc from the repositoryâ€™s history, effectively restoring it to the working directory.

Once flag.enc was recovered, the main.py script was used to decrypt it using the hardcoded AES-256-CBC key and IV. This produced the plaintext flag from the encrypted file.
