i am try to scan system for vulnerablities remotely

so i have delved into it for now, i have found few resources for that (i knew of them but never learnt about them)

nessus and exploit db mainly

how nessus is able to scan through ports and services

it's stil does signature based detection like AVs

learnt about remote scanning

went through this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG7HhqEJbTs&list=PLBf0hzazHTGM1gj702QWNKOjz12S0OWvx) for a better idea

realised muchh later that maybe open vas much be a better option

i'll  continue updating it
(ps: was doing hardware and design)
